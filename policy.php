In our China program, the child is transferred to the custody and control of the adoptive parents in their hotel or in the office of local government officials, in the presence of orphanage officials. All transfers occur during daylight hours, with a translator present,and appropriate clothing, food, and drinks are made available to the child and the parents at the time of the transfer.</p>

A list of outside organizations that provide financial assistance for adoption expenses can be found under Financing Adoption Expenses on this website. Our fee for homestudy services for MD and VA families is $1700 plus $300 for each post-adoption visit/report, with a minimum of three required.

                <p class="policytext mt-3">ADOPTME encourages anyone with concerns regarding services offered by ADOPTME to bring these concerns to the attention of a staff member. ADOPTME will work to resolve concerns informally. For individuals or organizations that feel their concerns have not been resolved informally, a formal complaint procedure is available. Birth parents, prospective adoptive parents, adoptive parents, or adoptees may file a complaint. The procedure for filing a complaint is set out in our Complaint Policy and Procedures found on our website.

ADOPTME will not take any action to discourage a client or prospective client from filing a complaint. CHAC will take no action to retaliate against a client or prospective client for making a complaint, expressing a grievance, providing information in writing or by interview to the accrediting body, or questioning the conduct of, or expressing an opinion about, the performance of ADOPTME.</p>

ADOPTME will obtain the specific written consent of the PAPs prior to spending any funds in excess of $1,000 for which the PAP will be held responsible.</p>

                <p class="policytext mt-3">One-half of our $500 application fee ($250) is refundable if a family decides not to proceed within two months of submitting application. All other ADOPTME Agency fees, which are paid in installments as the adoptions progress, are nonrefundable. In addition, $2500 of the Foreign Program Fee is due upon submission of documents for registration in the foreign program or acceptance of a child referral, whichever occurs first, and is non-refundable.

Homestudy clients pay a $500 deposit, which is non-refundable. The balance of the homestudy fee is paid prior to the social worker’s visit and is nonrefundable. Fees for post-adoption services are paid prior to completion of the homestudy and are non-refundable, unless the family relocates to another state, in which event any unused fees would be transferred to the new agency providing post-adoption services.

ADOPTME returns to clients any funds to which they may be entitled within sixty days of the completion of the delivery of services.</p>

                <p class="policytext mt-3">If the adoption is in Crisis, ADOPTME makes an effort to provide or arrange for counseling by an individual with appropriate skills to assist the family. If counseling does not succeed in resolving the crisis and the placement is disrupted or the adoption is dissolved, the placing assumes responsibility for making another placement of the child. ADOPTME will promptly (in accordance with any applicable legal requirements) remove the child if the placement is no longer in the child’s best interests. We do not return an adopted child whose adoption has been dissolved to his country of origin, as we believe the child’s needs can be better in any corner of the world. The adoptive family will have legal and financial responsibility for transfer of custody in the case of impending disruption or dissolution and for the care of the child.</p>
